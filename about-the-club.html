        A very good question. Ostensibly, we are devoted to furthering understanding and intution of higher spatial dimensions.
        We believe that comprehension of such topics is not as far fetched as it may initially appear, and that anyone can improve their understanding of such topics.

        In practice, we play games and hang out (the games are actually higher dimensional though). If 4D Connect 4 or 5D Chess With Multiverse Time Travel sound interesting
        to you, I'd recommend checking this out. Additionally, we talk about other fun topics like Doctor Who or Fascism (the latter is mostly brought up by Jack)
