<h2>
  2D Gravity Simulation
</h2>

<p><img src="img.png" class="image"/>
  This was my first major coding project, and upon seeing it, my programmer friend officially granted me the title of programmer, 
  an honour which I will never forget. This program simulates the solar system (or any gravitational system) in two dimensions, 
  and allows for easy viewing. Technically unfinished, as I never completed my rotational frame of reference, which would allow for 
  Lagrange points to be easily seen.

<h2>
  Ultimate Tic Tac Toe Collection
</h2>

<p><img src="img.png" class="image"/>
  My next major endeavor was making an ultimate collection of Tic Tac Toe variants, along with bots for each version. One of the variants 
  present, 3D quantum Tic Tac Toe, is not something that existed prior to me making this (as far as I can tell). Also unfinished, as I am 
  planning on polishing it and putting it on Steam someday (largely so for easy online multiplayer via steam remote play).

<h2>
  My next cool project
</h2>

<p><img src="img.png" class="image"/>
  The next cool thing I make will be cooler than anything that came before. It is unknown what shape or form it will take, but I assure you, 
  it will be cool.
