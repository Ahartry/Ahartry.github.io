    I've read quite a few books, so this page has some books I like and some thoughts on them. 
    I generally read sci-fi/fantasy and assorted nonfiction. The authors I've read the most are probably Isaac Asimov and Brandon Sanderson. 
    If you know of a book that you think I'd like, 
    please contact me through any means and let me know, as I will read it and get back to you about it.

    Some of my favourite sci-fi:

  <h2>
    The Dark Forest by Cixin Liu
  </h2>
  <p>
    Like Dune or Ender's Game, this series gets progressively weirder as it goes on (to be clear, when I say 'weird' I don't mean 'bad').
    I really enjoyed reading this, I liked the ending, probably won't say anything more (I went into this completely blind and really liked it,
    so I'm trying to let others experience it in the same way).

  <h2>
    The Mars Trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson
  </h2>
  <p>
    A very hard sci-fi series dealing with the colonization and terraforming of Mars. It's the most political sci-fi I've ever read, and
    I enjoyed every moment of it. It also manages to be profound, while at the same time sometimes reading like a textbook (in a good way). 
    Also a great way to learn Martian geography.

  <h2>
    Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams
  </h2>
  <p>
    A sci-fi comedy that explores the meaning of Life, the Universe, and Everything using witty language and relatable characters 
    (Arthur Dent my beloved). I highly recommend it, it's not a dense read, just get the series, you'll enjoy it.

  <h2>
    Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson
  </h2>
  <p>
    This book was my introduction to Brandon Sanderson, and it got me hooked on his works. It has my favourite magic system out of any fantasy I've read,
    and [INSERT REST OF OPINION]
