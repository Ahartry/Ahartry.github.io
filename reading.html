    I've read quite a few books, so this page has some books I like and some thoughts on them. 
    I generally read sci-fi/fantasy and assorted nonfiction. The authors I've read the most are probably Isaac Asimov and Brandon Sanderson. 
    If you know of a book that you think I'd like, 
    please contact me through any means and let me know, as I will read it and get back to you about it.

  <h1>
    Some of my favourite sci-fi:
  </h1>

  <h2>
    The Dark Forest by Cixin Liu
  </h2>
  <p>
    Like Dune or Ender's Game, this series gets progressively weirder as it goes on (to be clear, when I say 'weird' I don't mean 'bad').
    I really enjoyed reading this, I liked the ending, probably won't say anything more (I went into this completely blind and really liked it,
    so I'm trying to let others experience it in the same way).
    <br><br>

  <h2>
    The Mars Trilogy by Kim Stanley Robinson
  </h2>
  <p>
    A very hard sci-fi series dealing with the colonization and terraforming of Mars. It's the most political sci-fi I've ever read, and
    I enjoyed every moment of it. It also manages to be profound, while at the same time sometimes reading like a textbook (in a good way). 
    Also a great way to learn Martian geography.

  <h2>
    Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams
  </h2>
  <p>
    A sci-fi comedy that explores the meaning of Life, the Universe, and Everything using witty language and fun characters 
    (Arthur Dent my beloved). I highly recommend it, it's not a dense read, just get the series, you'll enjoy it.

  <h1>
    Some of my favourite fantasy:
  </h1>

  <h2>
    Mistborn by Brandon Sanderson
  </h2>
  <p>
    This book was my introduction to Brandon Sanderson, and it got me hooked on his writing. It has my favourite magic system out of any fantasy I've read,
    and it has a special place in my heart. I would definitely recommend it to those looking for a good fantasy book.
    <br><br>
  </p>

  <h2>
    The Stormlight Archive by Brandon Sanderson
  </h2>
  <p>
    Yes, more Brandon Sanderson. The Stormlight Archive is his largest work, with each volume coming in at over 1000 pages. With in-depth worldbuilding, 
    awesome magic, and very good mental health advice, the Stormlight Archive really just is great. If the length seems daunting, I'd recommend starting with his shorter works, 
    as the Stormlight Archive is a rather large commitment.

    Some of my favourite non-fiction:
  </h1>

  <h2>
    Godel, Escher, Bach by Douglas Hofstadter
  </h2>
  <p>
    This book explores how intelligence emerges by looking at things such as recursion and patterns, referencing the works of Godel, Escher, and Bach in a way
    that is truly magnificent. I don't think I can explain just how good this book is. At only 100 pages in it already secured its spot as one my favourite books of all time.
    I very much recommend it.
